<p>Hie there.Thank you for visiting my blog, i will try to tell you about myself in a few paragraphs.l gues you already know my name, just in case you don't my name is Ronald T Maravanyika am 25 years old.l have a mixed career path but believe me l will get it all together soon. </p>
<br/>
<p>l am a person who always loved programming, i was inspired from the movies series called "The NET".From there l owned my first laptop at the age of 12.l still remember that it was running on windows 98 operating system.l continued my education at a boarding school in Masvingo called Silveira High school and l completed in 2007 at this school there was no exposure to the internet or computer so i didn't do much with my passion for programming, then i went to do my 'A' level studies at a mission school called Mutendi high school and i did Maths,Physics and Chemistry.Again at this school l didn't get exposure to computers but l did got exposure to the internet through my mobile phone.Thats when things turned around.i remember reading an article that said you can bring programming to life through Robotics, so my search for robotics started and in my country there was only one University offering a degree programme close to that which was Chinhoyi University of Technology    </p>
<br/>
<p>
	In 2010 i started studying <a href="#" >Mechatronics Engineering</a> at the Chinhoyi University of Technology.i successfully completed my degree with a 2.1 degree class.During the period i was working for Unilever Zimbabwe as a projects coordinator, l applied for a scholarship offered by Muzinda Hub.Muzinda is a technological hub which teachs digital skills via the Treehouse learning platform based in USA.This is when l started learning PYTHON programming language.Python is an open source programming language used to programme almost everything.This was in 2015 and l learnt through the platform for 6 months and l manged to get a certificate
</p>
<br/>
<p>My first project was a downtime capturing web application and l did it as a case study for Unilever Zimbabwe.l did this project in partnership with Muzinda Hub and  the project was a success.My second big project was to create an thermography based expert system for condition monitoring, this project was a big challenge as i was still new to python programming language.However l managed to create the expert system.This blog is now my third project and this is the first project to be published because it is not sensitive,the other projects were not available for publishment due to their nature.So if you take a look at my projects they are Engineering projects but am using python to solve the problems.Python is not widely used in my country however, l have taken it upon me to enhance the use of python in my country.Recently, me and a team for young python developers (on the day of publishment of this blog) managed to carry out the first ever Django Girls Workshop in my country.Django girls is a two day workshop where we will be teaching young girls how to programme for free.YES for FREE!!!.This workshop was a success.l was one of the founder members of PyZIM, an association for python developers or programmers in my country, so i can now safely say that l am enhancing the use of python in my country after only a year of learning python.</p>
<br/>
<p>l think now you understand why my career path is that wide.i am a youngman full of energy and who does not seize to look for opportunities.This is due to my supporting family and girlfriend l have.I want to grow in both field of Software development and Engineering,l also want to give young people in my country python programming skills for free as they were offered to me by Muzinda hub, this is already in play and it will help to reduce poverty and enhance growth of my country economically.As a vote of thanks l want to thank God for everything,i want to thank my family for the support and my lovely girlfriend Gamuchirai Nyasha,l also want to thank Gracious Kadirire for everything he did in my Engineering career and last but not list l want to thank Anna Makarudze and Humphrey Batau, they are awesome working partners.Finally,all this l own it to Muzinda hub.Thank you for reading my blog l hope it was helpfull.Please contact me if you need anything.
